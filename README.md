# Gasket-Tofu

 Gasket mounted Tofu board.
 Meant to be built with H60, recommend cherry/gmk clip ins (NOT PLATE MOUNT) for spacebar clearance.

You can find the h60 [here](https://hineybush.com/collections/pcbs/products/h60-group-buy) or [here](https://www.apexkeyboards.ca/collections/keyboard-parts/products/h60-pcb)
The standard board uses a JST connector and [ai03's unified daughterboard](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard)
[Hiney's USB C Daughterboard](https://hineybush.com/collections/pcbs/products/usb-c-daughterboard) works as well
